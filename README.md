# **SHOPIFY-CLONE**
*Tailwind CSS* is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that allows you to custom-build designs eliminating opinionated component styles that you would anyway want to override. One of the best ways to practice *Tailwind CSS* is through mini-projects that can be completed in a few days or hours. This project of *SHOPIFY-CLONE* helped me in furnishing my *Tailwind CSS* skills.
